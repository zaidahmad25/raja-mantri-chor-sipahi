# Raja-Mantri-Chor-Sipahi

Yup, it's that game we used to play in schools with our friends to pass time and have fun. I've digitalized this game, so you can play this on your phone or whatever device you're using 😂

Made with Vanilla JS (yup no JQuery 😎)

Actually, this game has pushed me to learn JQuery. IT MAKES THINGS SO MUCH EASIER!!

## What is "Raja-Mantri-Chor-Sipahi"
➡️ In English, this would translate to- "King-Minister-Thief-Soldier". 

➡️ The game's pretty easy. Traditionally, you make 4 chits, shuffle and distribute them without looking. Then the person who gets the "Raja" a.k.a. King and "Mantri" a.k.a Minister, announce their roles. The "Raja" then use this common phrase-"Chor, Sipahi ka pata lagao" which means, "Find the thief and the soldier". The "Mantri" (minister) has to then guess the "Chor" (thief) from the remaining two people. 

➡️ If the guess is correct, the "Mantri" (minister) gets 500 points and the "Sipahi" (soldier) gets 200 points. But if the guess is wrong then the "Chor" (thief) gets 700 points (he basically steals the points from the "Mantri" and the "Chor". The "Raja" (king) always gets 1000 points.

➡️ The person with the highest points win!
